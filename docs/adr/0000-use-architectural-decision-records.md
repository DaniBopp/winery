# Use Architectural Decision Records

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Considered Alternatives

* No record
* [DecisionRecord](https://github.com/schubmat/DecisionCapture)
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), maintainable by [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions)
* [Other templates](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)

## Conclusion

* *Chosen Alternative: Decision Record*
* That template is lean and fits most the development style
